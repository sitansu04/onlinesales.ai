            if n < 10:
                out = n ** 2
            elif 10< n < 20 :
                out = 1
                for i in range(1, n - 10 + 1):
                    out *= i
            else:
                lim = n - 20
                out = lim * (lim +1)
                out = out // 2
            print(out)
        n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
        compute(n)
